# HW-for-verilog
homework for verilog
1.	Based on Dataflow model, design an 8 bits 2â€™s complement signed adder/ 
subtractor. In addition to the computation result, an extra flag bit F is needed to 
express if the result is overflow. (F=0, no overflow; F=1, overflow). Design Verilog 
file and a correspond testbench file, and wave figure (with decimal radix) must be 
attached.
